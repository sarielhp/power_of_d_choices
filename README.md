# power_of_d_choices
Some code to test variants of algorithms throwing n balls into n bins and using d chocies.

This tests and demonstrates the "power of 2 choices" when throwing n
balls into n bins. For more information, see class notes here:

The code was written for linux, but should compile with g++ under any
other reasonable (but naturally inferior) operating system. To build,
just issue `make` from the command line.

Usage:

`./choices 1000000 2`

Code written by Sariel Har-Peled. All bugs are the fault of somebody else.
